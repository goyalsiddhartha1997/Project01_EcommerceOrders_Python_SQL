E-commerce Orders Data Analysis Project 🚀

📄 Project Overview  
This project explores an E-commerce orders dataset using SQL and Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The analysis covers fundamental to advanced queries, providing insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product-level statistics.

🎯 Objectives  
The key questions solved in this project include:

🟢 Basic Queries:
1. 🌍 List of Unique Cities: Identified all unique cities where customers are located.
2. 🛒 Order Count for 2017: Determined the number of orders placed in 2017.
3. 💰 Total Sales per Category: Calculated the total sales across different product categories.
4. 📊 Percentage of Installment Payments: Analysed the percentage of orders paid via installments.
5. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer Distribution by State: Counted the number of customers from each state.

🟡 Intermediate Queries:
1. 📆 Monthly Orders in 2018: Analysed the number of orders placed per month in 2018.
2. 🏙️ Average Products per Order by City: Computed the average number of products ordered, grouped by customer city.
3. 📈 Revenue Contribution by Category: Calculated the percentage of total revenue generated by each product category.
4. 💸 Price vs Purchase Correlation: Analysed the correlation between product price and the number of times a product was purchased.
5. 🏆 Seller Revenue Ranking: Ranked sellers based on the total revenue they generated.

🔴 Advanced Queries:
1. 🔄 Moving Average of Order Values: Calculated the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
2. 📊 Cumulative Sales per Month: Determined the cumulative sales per month for each year.
3. 🚀 Year-over-Year Growth: Calculated the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
4. 🔁 Customer Retention Rate: Measured the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who made another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
5. 👑 Top Customers by Spending: Identified the top 3 customers who spent the most in each year.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies  
- SQL: Used to perform complex queries for extracting, filtering, and aggregating data.
- Python Libraries:
  - Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
  - NumPy: Numerical operations.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization to generate insights.

🔍 Key Insights  
- 📍 Customer Distribution: Gained a better understanding of customer demographics through unique cities and state-wise distribution.
- 📊 Sales Trends: Identified major sales trends, including the growth of installment payments and monthly sales patterns in 2018.
- 💵 Revenue Insights: Found that certain product categories and sellers significantly contributed to the overall revenue.
- 🛍️ Customer Behaviour: Uncovered trends in customer purchasing behaviour, including retention rates and top customers by spending.

📊 Visualization  
Various visualizations were generated using matplotlib and seaborn to support the findings, including:
- 📊 Bar charts for sales per category.
- 📈 Line plots for cumulative monthly sales and moving averages.
- 🔎 Scatter plots to examine the relationship between product price and purchase frequency.

🔚 Conclusion  
This project showcases the power of combining SQL with Python libraries to efficiently analyse large datasets and derive actionable insights. From basic summary statistics to advanced customer behaviour analysis, the findings can help drive business decisions in an e-commerce setting.
